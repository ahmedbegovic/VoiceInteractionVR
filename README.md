# VoiceInteractionVR
 
 This is a side project that uses SteamVR, Unity and Windows Speech to showcase interaction using voice in VR space.

 In this project, an user can move, rotate and interact with objects and the world using keyword recognition. There are also actions implemented using SteamVR and physical controllers
 such as teleportation and grabbing objects. For this project, I used assets and materials from the Asset Store to create the environment. The video showcasing the project is uploaded below:
